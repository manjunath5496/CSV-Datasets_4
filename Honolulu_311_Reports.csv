The crosswalk would connect the Mililani Ravine Park trail. I've seen several near-accidents involving pedestrians and cars (speeding down Makaikai). A crosswalk here is essential; speed tables or humps on either side of the crosswalk would only add value. There are LOTS of kids and families who walk/run/bike on this path in Mililani Mauka. I'd hate to see an accident happen that could've been easily avoided by putting in traffic calming devices to slow speeding drivers. Also, visibility is hampered by the fact that pedestrians crossing the street have a lower visibility on speeding cars since parked cars block the visual corridor along the street."

Last night while I was walking home from work near Varsity Pl and Kalo Pl, a homeless man followed me briefly and when I turned around he had just dropped a rusty steak knife and was picking it up. When I saw the knife I walked faster and he stopped following me. There are also many people living in their vehicles now that the students are not parking there. Also, a ton of litter lining the street. I do not feel safe in my neighborhood any longer, and I do not see the people gathering practicing any sort of social distancing. I often have to walk in the street to stay 6 feet away from them because they do not move out of the sidewalk. They are constantly looking through the 2615 Varsity Pl dumpster, which is located on private property. There is a man that rides his bicycle up and down the street all night and into the closed dog park next to the Humane Society - this man has circled me on his bicycle and yelled at me when I asked him to give me space."

Enforcement trucks arrived and did some clearing over the weekend, but the campers re-established their sites shortly after the trucks left.  Neighborhood residents are forced to drive with extreme caution when we round the Lunalilo/Keeaumoku bend due to campers standing in the street or walking back and forth across the street. In addition to illegal camping and littering, we're concerned about trespassing and potential burglaries.  One camper has set up under the plumeria tree near the end of our 1420 Lunalilo St. driveway, and is too close for comfort. Requesting assistance, Mahalo!"

To me it just didn’t make sense so the next day I went for a walk around the block and I shocked to what I saw, about 6 or more cars around that block had nails in the tires and some had two nails in one tire which was shocking to me.
