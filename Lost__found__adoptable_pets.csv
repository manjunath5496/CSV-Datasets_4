My name is Buddy and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on April 8, 2020  because of some landlord issues. I lived in a home with men and women. My previous owner described me as nervous but energetic and sweet.<p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! At the shelter I am practicing how to ""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", ""down"" <p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. One of my most favorite activities is playing fetch! I can chase after that ball for hours!<p/><p/>My caregivers have discovered that I LOVE playing with other dogs! While at the shelter I play with dogs who are about the same size as me, but I have played with both male and female dogs. I would do best with another dog who likes to rough house and run around together.<p/><p/>One of my biggest quirks is how insecure I am around strangers but especially men. I can be a bit shy and aloof when you first meet me, but after I warm up I love to cuddle and stick by your side. However, I am still super nervous around men and would probably do best in a home that is a lower traffic enviornment, and maybe even a household with no men until I have had some training under my belt. <p/><p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited dog with a fun-loving personality! I am still working on my manners, so I would do best with a family who is willing to work with me and help me become the best dog I can be!<p/>",RED

My previous owner described me as shy, but loving.<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home!<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I do not seem to get along with other cats, so I may do best as the only cat in my new home.<p/><p/>Because of my shy nature, I would do best in a calm, quiet home.<p/><p/>I like getting attention on my own terms. I can get overstimulated with petting, so please move carefully with me and keep an eye out for signs that I might need a break.<p/><p/>My personality color is RED. I am a spirited cat with a fun-loving personality! I may be sensitive to handling, so I would do best in a home with a cat savvy family who knows when to give me some space.<p/>",RED

My name is Tucker and I am available for adoption. I am a 3 year old neutered male Doberman who weighs about 80 pounds.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on March 27, 2020 because their yard was not secure enough to contain me. My previous owner has had me since I was 5 months old. They said I am like a shadow! I constantly wants to be with my people and will stick by your side anywhere you go in the house. I am potty trained but not crate trained. I have never been around kids before and would probably do better with older children. I was raised with cats, and can be picky about my dog friends.<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. <p/><p/>I am looking for a family that will be devoted to working with me especially when it comes to potential separation anxiety and my impressive escape artist skills. If these are situations you have not dealt with before, I may not be the best fit for you.<p/><p/>My personality color is BLUE. I am a gentle and loving dog who likes to take things slow. I may get nervous in new situations, so I am looking for a family who understands that I might take some time to warm up. Once I get to know you, I will be a very devoted friend!<p/><p/>",BLUE

My name is Yuki and I am available for adoption.<p/><p/>I was brought in by my previous owner on May 7, 2020 because I was not living well with the small dog in the home. I lived in a home with other large dogs. My previous owner described me as outgoing, affectionate and very playful!<p/><p/>I am a very smart dog! At the shelter I am practicing how to [""sit"", ""stay"", ""come"", ""down"" and ""shake"".]<p/><p/>I am an affectionate lovebug who would be thrilled to cuddle up with you at home! I am a big ball of love, I enjoy being right by your side and will even encourage you to pet me!<p/><p/>I am full of energy and I love to play! I tend to calm down more when the people around me stay calm. I do best when I have lots of exercise and something to keep my mind busy. You can plan on throwing the ball for me over and over again, and running around the yard with me to help me burn off my energy.<p/><p/>My caregivers have noticed that I seem to do well with other large dogs. When meeting dogs in a new home, I would do best with a slow introduction. Unfortunately I do not get along with small dogs, and most likely cats, so I would need to be in a home with only large dogs as my animal companions.<p/><p/>My personality color is GREEN. I am an adaptable dog who loves to go with the flow! I am outgoing and carefree, and I just can't wait to find my forever home!<p/><p/><p/>",GREEN
