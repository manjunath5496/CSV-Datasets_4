Napeague BCA,Suffolk,Town of East Hampton,Region 1,Hither Hills State Park,41.01626093,-72.02413502,"Pelagic bird site; diverse species concentration site; and species at risk site. Pelagic birds in the BCA include least terns and, until recently, common terns. Hicks Island had supported an average of 25 pairs of least terns per year for 14 years (2000, Evans et al.) and an average of 106 pairs of common terns per year for 15 years (2000, Evans et al.). In 2006, within the BCA, there were 35 pairs of least terns on Hicks Island, 17 pairs at Goff Point and 3 pairs at Napeague Beach (2006, Coy) although they were unsuccessful (see below). Diversity of birds is due in part to the fact that Napeague/Hither Hills is part of one of the largest, relatively unfragmented areas of maritime open space on eastern Long Island. Diversity of breeding birds is high including beach/dune species such as piping plover, least terns and American oystercatchers. Roseate terns and black skimmers have bred here in the past.

Species at risk include both breeding and wintering species. The area around Napeague Harbor is one of the few sites on eastern Long Island that is still occupied by northern harriers during the breeding season. In addition to breeding by state threatened species, northern harrier and least terns, and species of special concern, osprey, the site also hosts state endangered wintering short-eared owls. The state-endangered/federally threatened piping plover nests at Hicks Island, Goff Point and Napeague Beach. In 2006, 23 pairs fledged 11 young. In 2005, 18 pairs fledged 23 young. The Hicks Island common tern colony was one of the more successful sites for common terns on Long Island (Evans, et. al. 2000). Habitat still exists and the site will be managed to increase the chance for nesting success.","The coastal beaches at Hicks Island, Napeague Beach and Goff Point are critical nesting habitat for piping plovers and least terns.

The site is a regular hot spot for spring migrating waterfowl. Examples include 5,000 scaup in 2000 and 2,600 scaup in 2003. Wood ducks are also reported to use the site in fall in numbers from 2,000 in the past to 400 in 2005. Several pairs of pied-billed grebes also breed here. Breeding prothonotary warbler and cerulean warbler numbers are locally high. At least 90 great blue heron nests are found in a flooded hardwood swamp. American bittern and least bittern are probable breeders and black-crowned night-heron is a possible breeder. Species of concern include: pied-billed grebe, least bittern, northern harrier, American bittern, osprey, Cooper's hawk, red-shouldered hawk, and cerulean warbler. Sedge wren was recently recorded singing in the breeding season but nesting has not been confirmed. Henslow's sparrow historically bred here in 1980s-90s.","Extensive wetland communities consisting of red maple-hardwood swamp, silver maple-ash swamp, northern white-cedar swamp and marsh communities. Lake waters adjacent to the property harbor thousands of waterfowl throughout the year. Grasslands are found that could provide habitat if properly managed.","(43.26091587, -76.06872485)"
