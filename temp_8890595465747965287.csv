7085097,Concrete and Sidewalk Repair,"Dear Madam or Sir,In September, through the ArlingtonVA Service Request website, I submitted the following request for a sidewalk repair at 1701 N Kenilworth St:“A large oak tree died last year and had to be removed. The tree's trunk had impinged upon the sidewalk, and its removal leaves a large gap in the sidewalk that is dangerous for elderly people and for children riding bicycles. Therefore, a sidewalk repair is required. Roughly, a strip of sidewalk about 8-feet long needs to be inserted to fill in the gap. I would prefer if cement be used as opposed to simply trying to pave over the area. The sidewalk should be fully restored, so that the repaired area fully matches the sidewalk on either side of the repair. Note that we did not plant the tree (which died last year), nor did the previous owner of the house. As best as I can tell, the tree has always been the responsibility of the county, since the tree lay on country property. Therefore, I think the country should do the right thing and implement a quality repair, as opposed to simply applying a bit of mismatched pavement.”I have attached the photo that I submitted with my request. This repair is urgently needed because there are both small children and elderly people in this neighborhood, and we have already had a number of bad falls. There are no nearby street-lights, which makes the sidewalk particular treacherous at night.Can you please provide an update of the status of my request? Does Arlington County intend to make this repair?Best Regards,Patrick Wiese",COMPLETED,38.8873563,-77.1367193,"1701 North Kenilworth Street, Arlington, VA, USA",11/18/2019 3:36:58 PM,11/18/2019 3:36:58 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Concrete and Sidewalk Repair

Myer Drive on the south side of Wilson Blvd. to get to the ART 43 bus stop. Traffic turning onto SB N. Ft. Myer off of WB Wilson is often in a hurry to make the left turn, and I have seen many instances where pedestrians were nearly struck while crossing on the walk signal, especially now that daylight savings time has ended and it is getting dark before 5pm. Something should be done to either increase visibility of the cross walk (e.g. flashing lights during the walk signal) or the signals at the intersection should be reprogrammed to allow pedestrians to cross before the light turns green on Wilson. I currently feel safer crossing Ft. Myer on the 'don't walk' signal, because it is easier to see whether traffic is traveling south on Ft. Myer, than to dodge cars turning off of Wilson onto Ft.

7116320,Traffic Sign Damaged/Missing,"At this intersection, there are many problems creating danger for school kids walking to and from school here each day. There are NO Pedestrian Crossing signs at all, or they are missing. The crosswalk lines are faint, the stop line is not where cars try to stop. Almost all cars don't fully stop though, given my observations. They roll-stop at the crosswalk lines, way in front of the stop sign and stop line, blocking the crosswalk. There is high-speed turning traffic off of Carlin Springs at the same time. There is low visibility due to hills and high-speed traffic. I believe any injuries or fatalities here have been prevented by good middle-schooler kid reaction times, and that the kids learn to negotiate with drivers a way across the street. Stop by one morning and watch. I know of a Kenmore student reporting being almost hit here a few times this school year. While I'm sure that Arlington County has a long-term study and a 'corridor' improvement plan for many years out, what can be done right now, asap? Pedestrian signs should be inexpensive. Full-thickness crosswalk paint on the pavement should be inexpensive. Utility poles exist at locations where pedestrian signs might can be attached to those, reducing cost. Please assist. Please protect these school kids.

7173695,Signal Analysis,"This relates to the area where Washington Blvd 'splits'. When a car coming from Wilson Blvd. leaving Clarendon has just started to bear right on Washington Blvd., it encounters a traffic signal. If it's red, you have to stop quickly after passing Irving. The signal coordinates with a signal stopping traffic coming up Washington Blvd. going into Clarendon so that pedestrians can cross both roads on the same red. This past week, the car behind me became impatient (the signal is VERY short, height-wise, so she may not have seen it); she drove around me on the left,  pulled ahead and proceeded down the road, causing a pedestrian to stop in his tracks after crossing Washington Blvd. going into Clarendon. That person still had a lot of seconds to go on the pedestrian go-ahead light. A second time this week, traffic stopped behind me at the light and people were honking.

If you are traveling west on 8th street and attempting to turn right or left onto N Monroe St, this is a blind turn due to the cars parked on N. Monroe St., and cars are traveling too fast on N.

7215583,Traffic Sign Damaged/Missing,"OfHi, I’m not sure if I’m submitting this service request through the correct problem type, but the gist of the issue is this: the merge ramp from 50-E onto Washington Blvd (27) S is a complete hazard to driver safety. Two dangerous things are happening in an area that is too small for either: (1) after a yield sign that no one seems to heed, traffic is merging from 50-E on to Washington Blvd S, simultaneously while traffic from Washington Blvd is also using the same lane to exit on to the Court House Rd; (2) traffic from Court House Rd is entering from a full stop on to Washington Blvd S via a right turn in the same merge lane described earlier. It’s really amazing to me, every day, taking this exit that there haven’t been more serious or even fatal accidents at the interchange. The signage in place does not convey the danger to traffic from any direction.  My instinct is the one of the above exits/entrances probably should be closed, but absent that — could you please study how to actually slow the flow of traffic from 50 on to Washington Blvd, such that people can more safely merge in the other directions?",COMPLETED,38.873897,-77.082829,"2101–2111 S Washington Blvd,Arlington, VA 22204",12/17/2019 4:02:06 AM,12/17/2019 4:02:06 AM,This is visible to Everyone,Traffic Sign Damaged/Missing

7290449,Customer Inquiries,"A code inspector told me this morning that I can no longer use a very old black county trash container for yard waste. He even issued me a code violation!I will explain my objections here and tell you my solution.I have used this old container for years for yard waste and it has always been emptied. I place it next to my green container and any paper bags or personal barrels containing yard waste (which the inspector said will still be picked up). So there has never been any confusion about what is yard waste. The inspector said that the new contractor is following the rules by not picking up anything in a black container. (Never mind that this one is bigger, beat up, and has no lid; and yesterday was obviously filled with leaves.) However, he said personal containers, like trash cans, are still OK. Reusing this old container is more environmentally sound than using paper bags, so I plan to personalize it. I will paint it green and label is as yard waste. I trust this will sufficiently differentiate it.Toby McIntosh",COMPLETED,38.8834721,-77.0965783,"917 North Irving Street, Arlington, VA, USA",1/6/2020 3:04:11 PM,1/6/2020 3:04:11 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Customer Inquiries

7329783,Facilities Damaged,"There is only one functional stream crossing in the entire park (the concrete bridge by the picnic shelter). The upstream steel and wood bridge has been declared unsafe and blocked off for over a year. The remaining two steel and wood bridges washed away in the July 2019 flood. The downstream concrete crossing is always flooded. This severely restricts the usage of the park. Not to mention the deteriorated trails running parallel to the stream banks which are being eaten away. Now, every single time it rains, the banks and crossings degrade further, due to the extreme increase in runoff from the elimination of permeable ground over the past two years by the 'Abingdon Estates' mansion developments (Carlin Springs and N. Abingdon St.) overwhelming the creek's capacity. How can we fix this?

7441264,Parking Signs Damaged/Missing,"Commercial vehicles (dump trucks, meat trucks, semis, and other industrial trucks consistently are parking in front of the neighborhood streets on Shirlington Road and Kemper Rd intersection (Shirlington Crest neighborhood) all night long and all weekend long (typically parked there from noon on Friday until early hours Monday morning). They block the view from families in cars exiting onto Shirlington Road from Kemper Road (accident waiting to happen).  This parking of industrial vehicles also keeps any cars belonging to residents/guests of the townhouse community (Shirlington Crest) from parking near their houses on nights/weekends.  There needs to be a 'No Commercial Parking' sign in this area on Shirlington Road—this sign is posted on other streets in and around the neighborhood.  This was a tragic county/city oversight and needs to be corrected.  This is a safety issue as residents/guests of residents have to park on four mile run (where there is commercial parking available) instead of where the parking was intended to be for residents and business patrons, which was in front of the townhouses when the parking was designed/implemented in the ~2012 timeframe.  This was not intended as a nights and weekend parking lot for commercial vehicles who should be storing their vehicles overnight/on weekends at their place of business. I have lived here since the townhouses were built when no parking existed in front of the community on Shirlington Road and there were four lanes of traffic (no parking) in lieu of what exists today with two lanes of traffic and limited parking--I would have never bought here or pay the taxes had I known commercial trucks would begin parking here every night and weekends consistently.  Please help stop these large, commercial trucks from parking here.  They should park (store) their commercial vehicles at their place of business after hours, and not in front of residences who need these parking spaces.  Or, please change the parking zone to residential only, or paid parking on weekends.  As part of the remedy, my neighbors have begun parking in the Shirlington Crest alleyways which is against the law (there are signs restricting parking) and is a fire hazard, yet my tax-paying neighbors are punished by breaking the law, but the trucks (one with New Jersey license plates--Pat La Frieda Meat Purveyor) who park all night and weekends in parking spaces in front of our community and these commercial trucks/drives suffer no consequences.  Please help fix this with the simple sign that says 'No Commercial Parking,' and ticket them when they do park in these spaces.  Or, put a pay-to-park there.  This will begin (if not already) impacting property values (and therefore taxes paid) to improve our community.

7446552,Signal Maintenance,"buses are forced to queue well past the stop bar and encroach into the crosswalk in order for the bus to be detected by the system. This practice violates bus operator training guidelines which dictates that operators must wait a prescribed distant away from the stop bar. If an operator follows their training and waits ahead of the stop bar, the signal would never allow buses to leave the bus loop – leading to buses running red lights. Some buses have made illegal left turns onto Northbound N. Sycamore as a result. While we have gotten away with this for a number of years, this is not safe. In addition, with the upcoming Platform Improvement Project in the summer of 2020, we will have dozens of bus operators who are not familiar with this signal using this station and this will cause congestion within the bus loop that will rapidly spill out onto southbound North Sycamore Street impeding the flow of traffic.due to the number of buses that will enter and exit the station starting this summer, the request from Metrobus planning to the Transit bureau is to switch from loop detection to video detection.",IN_PROGRESS,38.8865723693093,-77.1564453190492,"East Falls Church Metro, Sycamore Street @ Bay A, Arlington, VA 22205, USA",2/6/2020 10:56:34 PM,2/6/2020 10:56:34 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Signal Maintenance

7461985,Sight Distance Evaluation,"I have noticed that visibility is poor when traveling south on N Vermont road crossing N Carlin Springs road (where N Vermont Road turns into N Park dr). Due to street parking, when traveling south and crossing the intersection or turning left, it is very difficult to see east bound traffic that may be approaching. Because of this, I usually have to pull out into the intersection to get an adequate view, putting myself at risk for a collision. Today when driving home from work this nearly happened. I would estimate a near accident happens about 4 times a month to just me in this intersection (I drive through this intersection at least once a day).  As it is a busy area in North Arlington I am sure I am not alone.I propose removing the street parking on the North side of N Carlin Springs Road between N Vermont and the driveway of 4503 N Carlin Springs road.  This will only remove 2 parking spaces so will not have a significant impact on street parking, but will dramatically improve visibility when traveling southbound through that intersection.

7465535,Street Surface Damaged,"Hello,I live at 2329 N Vermont Street, Arlington, VA 22207.Over the past few weeks we had four water main breaks in our neighborhood. If this were not bad enough, the subsequent repairs have caused extensive damage to the street surface, which was only temporarily patched up:- One area is simply filled with gravel, without even asphalt on top- In other areas, asphalt was laid by hand, using shovels, so it is obviously very uneven. What is worse, it will not last even a few months given the heavy traffic on the street.At the end of the last year our street was completely repaved, and new asphalt with new markings was installed. I would like to request that the County fixes the street and returns the pavement to the state it was before all those water main breaks.I would like to see all those extremely high water bills being put to good use.Thank you,Mikhail Dobrolioubov2329 N Vermont Street, Arlington VA 22207617-901-3366",IN_PROGRESS,38.9022694,-77.1182013,"2329 North Vermont Street, Arlington, VA, USA",2/11/2020 4:47:21 PM,2/11/2020 4:47:21 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Street Surface Damaged

7446552,Signal Maintenance,"buses are forced to queue well past the stop bar and encroach into the crosswalk in order for the bus to be detected by the system. This practice violates bus operator training guidelines which dictates that operators must wait a prescribed distant away from the stop bar. If an operator follows their training and waits ahead of the stop bar, the signal would never allow buses to leave the bus loop – leading to buses running red lights. Some buses have made illegal left turns onto Northbound N. Sycamore as a result. While we have gotten away with this for a number of years, this is not safe. In addition, with the upcoming Platform Improvement Project in the summer of 2020, we will have dozens of bus operators who are not familiar with this signal using this station and this will cause congestion within the bus loop that will rapidly spill out onto southbound North Sycamore Street impeding the flow of traffic.due to the number of buses that will enter and exit the station starting this summer, the request from Metrobus planning to the Transit bureau is to switch from loop detection to video detection.",IN_PROGRESS,38.8865723693093,-77.1564453190492,"East Falls Church Metro, Sycamore Street @ Bay A, Arlington, VA 22205, USA",2/6/2020 10:56:34 PM,2/6/2020 10:56:34 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Signal Maintenance

7085097,Concrete and Sidewalk Repair,"Dear Madam or Sir,In September, through the ArlingtonVA Service Request website, I submitted the following request for a sidewalk repair at 1701 N Kenilworth St:“A large oak tree died last year and had to be removed. The tree's trunk had impinged upon the sidewalk, and its removal leaves a large gap in the sidewalk that is dangerous for elderly people and for children riding bicycles. Therefore, a sidewalk repair is required. Roughly, a strip of sidewalk about 8-feet long needs to be inserted to fill in the gap. I would prefer if cement be used as opposed to simply trying to pave over the area. The sidewalk should be fully restored, so that the repaired area fully matches the sidewalk on either side of the repair. Note that we did not plant the tree (which died last year), nor did the previous owner of the house. As best as I can tell, the tree has always been the responsibility of the county, since the tree lay on country property. Therefore, I think the country should do the right thing and implement a quality repair, as opposed to simply applying a bit of mismatched pavement.”I have attached the photo that I submitted with my request. This repair is urgently needed because there are both small children and elderly people in this neighborhood, and we have already had a number of bad falls. There are no nearby street-lights, which makes the sidewalk particular treacherous at night.Can you please provide an update of the status of my request? Does Arlington County intend to make this repair?Best Regards,Patrick Wiese",COMPLETED,38.8873563,-77.1367193,"1701 North Kenilworth Street, Arlington, VA, USA",11/18/2019 3:36:58 PM,11/18/2019 3:36:58 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Concrete and Sidewalk Repair

7215583,Traffic Sign Damaged/Missing,"OfHi, I’m not sure if I’m submitting this service request through the correct problem type, but the gist of the issue is this: the merge ramp from 50-E onto Washington Blvd (27) S is a complete hazard to driver safety. Two dangerous things are happening in an area that is too small for either: (1) after a yield sign that no one seems to heed, traffic is merging from 50-E on to Washington Blvd S, simultaneously while traffic from Washington Blvd is also using the same lane to exit on to the Court House Rd; (2) traffic from Court House Rd is entering from a full stop on to Washington Blvd S via a right turn in the same merge lane described earlier. It’s really amazing to me, every day, taking this exit that there haven’t been more serious or even fatal accidents at the interchange. The signage in place does not convey the danger to traffic from any direction.  My instinct is the one of the above exits/entrances probably should be closed, but absent that — could you please study how to actually slow the flow of traffic from 50 on to Washington Blvd, such that people can more safely merge in the other directions?",COMPLETED,38.873897,-77.082829,"2101–2111 S Washington Blvd,Arlington, VA 22204",12/17/2019 4:02:06 AM,12/17/2019 4:02:06 AM,This is visible to Everyone,Traffic Sign Damaged/Missing

7465535,Street Surface Damaged,"Hello,I live at 2329 N Vermont Street, Arlington, VA 22207.Over the past few weeks we had four water main breaks in our neighborhood. If this were not bad enough, the subsequent repairs have caused extensive damage to the street surface, which was only temporarily patched up:- One area is simply filled with gravel, without even asphalt on top- In other areas, asphalt was laid by hand, using shovels, so it is obviously very uneven. What is worse, it will not last even a few months given the heavy traffic on the street.At the end of the last year our street was completely repaved, and new asphalt with new markings was installed. I would like to request that the County fixes the street and returns the pavement to the state it was before all those water main breaks.I would like to see all those extremely high water bills being put to good use.Thank you,Mikhail Dobrolioubov2329 N Vermont Street, Arlington VA 22207617-901-3366",IN_PROGRESS,38.9022694,-77.1182013,"2329 North Vermont Street, Arlington, VA, USA",2/11/2020 4:47:21 PM,2/11/2020 4:47:21 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Street Surface Damaged

7410508,Street Surface Damaged,"This issue has been evolving since they re-paved S Carlin Springs Rd last summer.Since that time, seeping water has kept this spot wet and it is slowly progressing into a small pothole, about 6' in diameter.Additionally, because the water is constantly flowing, when the temperature reaches freezing, it creates a large patch of ice until it thaws as temperature rises.It appears that it could be one of two things; 1) a natural spring in the location that would need to be capped and re-routed to avoid erosion (larger pothole or sinkhole situation) or 2) a leak in the water main that could rupture and cause a larger situation (Sinkhole, etc).

7173695,Signal Analysis,"This relates to the area where Washington Blvd 'splits'. When a car coming from Wilson Blvd. leaving Clarendon has just started to bear right on Washington Blvd., it encounters a traffic signal. If it's red, you have to stop quickly after passing Irving. The signal coordinates with a signal stopping traffic coming up Washington Blvd. going into Clarendon so that pedestrians can cross both roads on the same red. This past week, the car behind me became impatient (the signal is VERY short, height-wise, so she may not have seen it); she drove around me on the left,  pulled ahead and proceeded down the road, causing a pedestrian to stop in his tracks after crossing Washington Blvd. going into Clarendon. That person still had a lot of seconds to go on the pedestrian go-ahead light. A second time this week, traffic stopped behind me at the light and people were honking. I couldn't proceed because of the red light and the fact that pedestrians were crossing Washington Blvd., having a pedestrian go ahead light and 20 seconds or so remaining. Accidents are just waiting to happen here.

I have some empathy for those turning left. It is a long intersection to cross, and after crossing the intersection myself I witnessed a bus driver honking from behind at someone else trying make the left turn. The trouble with this flashing yellow light should be obvious to anyone who observes the traffic flow for ten minutes at noon.

However, its been an ongoing issue for at least a year. After R.E. Lee Electric enacted the LED test on all of 6th Street, we've been having issues with the street lights going out at night. Our neighbors have found the breaker and have been manually resetting it themselves to recover from the outage. Even though the lights are being reset manually through the breaker, once it rains, the lights go out again. This is a major safety issue that needs to be addressed immediately, not by switching a breaker, but by permanent repair.

Car traffic will run through the yield sign only to be in conflict with someone walking in the street that they did not stop to see. This situation is aggravated by a lack of sidewalks or safe places for pedestrians. This is a situation where - if you come out and check it - a car headed east on 25th St approaching the intersection absolutely cannot see if there are any pedestrians walking in the road towards them. There are huge azaleas there that are overgrown (and quite wonderful). This is a walking neighborhood with children walking to bus stops, lots of people walking their dogs, people walking to Lee Hwy to the bus line.... Unfortunately on N Vernon St pedestrian / car conflicts are common due to a lack of sidewalks.

Myer Drive on the south side of Wilson Blvd. to get to the ART 43 bus stop. Traffic turning onto SB N. Ft. Myer off of WB Wilson is often in a hurry to make the left turn, and I have seen many instances where pedestrians were nearly struck while crossing on the walk signal, especially now that daylight savings time has ended and it is getting dark before 5pm. Something should be done to either increase visibility of the cross walk (e.g. flashing lights during the walk signal) or the signals at the intersection should be reprogrammed to allow pedestrians to cross before the light turns green on Wilson. I currently feel safer crossing Ft. Myer on the 'don't walk' signal, because it is easier to see whether traffic is traveling south on Ft. Myer, than to dodge cars turning off of Wilson onto Ft.

7461985,Sight Distance Evaluation,"I have noticed that visibility is poor when traveling south on N Vermont road crossing N Carlin Springs road (where N Vermont Road turns into N Park dr). Due to street parking, when traveling south and crossing the intersection or turning left, it is very difficult to see east bound traffic that may be approaching. Because of this, I usually have to pull out into the intersection to get an adequate view, putting myself at risk for a collision. Today when driving home from work this nearly happened. I would estimate a near accident happens about 4 times a month to just me in this intersection (I drive through this intersection at least once a day).  As it is a busy area in North Arlington I am sure I am not alone.I propose removing the street parking on the North side of N Carlin Springs Road between N Vermont and the driveway of 4503 N Carlin Springs road.  This will only remove 2 parking spaces so will not have a significant impact on street parking, but will dramatically improve visibility when traveling southbound through that intersection.  I have attached a photo taken today to illustrate lack of visibility. The photo is taken from the south lane of N Vermont looking across Carlin Springs road and slightly to the west.",COMPLETED,38.8762811,-77.1135624,n carlin springs rd and n vermont st,2/10/2020 9:41:15 PM,2/10/2020 9:41:15 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Sight Distance Evaluation

7439664,Signal Maintenance,"Hi - the stoplight at N. Pierce and Wilson was moved to a kind of weird location that's confusing to drivers. I've attached a photo. The red line is where cars are supposed to be stopping on Wilson and the yellow line is the stoplight. With this amount of space, people are stopping well into the intersection with N. Pierce. Additionally, people turning left off of N. Pierce are also getting confused and stopping when they get to the light, since they're driving about two full car lengths before they see it and they're not sure if it's for them. At the end of the day, it's nearly impossible to get off N. Pierce St. between the cars blocking the intersection and the cars slamming on their brakes once they turn left. Please, can we move the light back to where it used to be? You can see there's still a bar hanging over the red line. Or at the very least paint clear stop lines/put up adequate signage.

7653265,Mowing,"To Whom it may concern:  Our intersection noted above has been under maintenance for new traffic signals for the last 6 months,  The job has been completed and the nubs extending into the intersection were pretty much destroyed by the work - I was assured by the county these areas would be returned to their prior state.  Upon completion the crew, through down some grass seed and straw - that was it.  The straw has now blown all over my yard and into the storm drain at the intersection and the nubs are a muddy mess.  I would ask that someone survey this in person so they can see the damage and get a crew out to sod the area ASAP as they should have done initially to avoid this situation.  I have not minded maintaining these areas since the nubs were put in and have even added some plantings to enhance the aesthetics - I'm only asking your assistance to return it to a manageable state.  Again, my entire front and side yard as well as the storm drains at the intersection are full of straw as a result.    Thanks and if this is not  the correct place to send this request, please route it appropriately and keep me informed.  Thank you.

7865787,Mowing,"This is a cleanup issue related to the median that runs the length of North Kirkwood Road.  Debris and plant growth seems to accumulate on both sides of the median strip, which impedes the flow of storm water, a concern of mine since last year's flash flood that backed up storm water into my basement.  Neither street sweeping (which I've observed sweeping only the outer curbs) nor median mowing seems responsible for removing debris in which plant material grows unimpeded.  Two days ago, before the latest heavy rain, a neighbor and I removed that which had accumulated on the west side of the median between 1700 and 1704 N Kirkwood.   The debris and growing plants were surprisingly easy to remove, almost like rolling up pieces of sod but an inherently dangerous activity for us as traffic sped by.   My purpose in raising this clean up issue is to ask for assistance in keeping the median sides of Kirkwood Road clear of debris so that it does not add to the problem of managing storm water run off.",SUBMITTED,38.8904463,-77.1009908,"N Kirkwood Rd, Arlington, VA, USA",5/1/2020 3:37:12 PM,5/1/2020 3:37:12 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Mowing

The path isn't visible from the fields so it's easy for kids to gather, but there hasn't been any problem in the past.  The gate from our backyard is immediately in line with the hole that's been dug.  We don't go in the woods on the path because of the poison ivy, so we hadn't noticed the hole being dug, but began hearing the activity behind the fence and saw the hole.

7894727,Street Surface Damaged,"from: Bruce and Doreen Leighton <leightonva@hotmail.com>; Bruce Leighton <rleighton@iadb.org>Subject: Fw: Community Improvement Proposal: 'Lake Edison' Dear Sir / Madam,We are writing regarding a longstanding drainage problem in our neighborhood, which has worsened in recent years.  We wish to request your assistance in addressing/resolving this issue. The specific location is across from 742 North Edison Street , which runs parallel to the walking path, directly behind Pupatella’s Restaurant and near the corner of Wilson Blvd and George Mason. This section of North Edison adjoining the park has over time subsided and created a sizeable indentation in the Street (which doubles as the bicycle path). Whenever it rains, water drains from all directions into the indentation and creates a pond.  During serious rainfalls this section of North Edison is completely flooded and the street/path becomes impassable for pedestrian or bicycle traffic.  There is little to no drainage into the park, which also floods when it rains - recent photo attached.For those living at this end of North Edison Street, this essentially cuts off pedestrian access to our houses during rainy periods.   In 2018 when it rained constantly, the pond was a permanent fixture, becoming known in the community as “Lake Edison”.   With no drainage, it became a breeding ground for insects and other small animals living behind the restaurants on Wilson Blvd.    The problem has worsened with time,  affecting anyone using North Edison or the bicycle/walking paths (i.e. almost everyone in Bluemont). The most feasible solution would likely entail re-grading / re-paving a small section of North Edison St, as well as improving drainage into the park. The neighborhood has raised this issue more than once with Arlington County in recent years, to date with no results.We would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this longstanding problem.If you have any questions or comments, I am reachable at this email address or at ph# 703 243 0301 /cellphone 202 412 1465.Best RegardsR.

7789503,Street Surface Damaged,"I have written several times about this issue but it is now severe and deserves a proper solution from the county.  There is groundwater that continuously bubbles up to the pavement; it is not a leak of any pipes, rather it's groundwater from an underground spring.  It has caused severe strain on our sump pump systems because a lot of the water remains underground and follows the slope directly towards our house and its foundation.  The county has looked at it twice since we moved in to the county and said there's nothing they can do. However, I have asked several landscape professionals and they say there is a solution - the county just has to invest the time and money to fix it.  Can the county seriously look at this issue and commit to a solution?  It would likely involve digging a trench to divert the water off the surface and directly into the sewer.  The trench might need to be lined with gravel.  This has been a headache for me since I purchased the home in August and is causing a lot of underground water pressure on my house and the sump pump, which is regularly working to try to remove all the water that accumulates around our foundation.  In the winter, as I've written to the county before, the surface water freezes creating an ice sheet on the street, which is extremely dangerous for anyone who parks in front of our home.  We have slipped several times on it.  My wife is pregnant and we will soon have a baby at home and I would like this fixed before this becomes a serious issue.  This is the third time I'm writing the county about this issue, which remains unresolved.  Please do not be in a hurry to simply reply to this email, send someone over for a cursory check, and close the ticket.

7441264,Parking Signs Damaged/Missing,"Commercial vehicles (dump trucks, meat trucks, semis, and other industrial trucks consistently are parking in front of the neighborhood streets on Shirlington Road and Kemper Rd intersection (Shirlington Crest neighborhood) all night long and all weekend long (typically parked there from noon on Friday until early hours Monday morning). They block the view from families in cars exiting onto Shirlington Road from Kemper Road (accident waiting to happen).  This parking of industrial vehicles also keeps any cars belonging to residents/guests of the townhouse community (Shirlington Crest) from parking near their houses on nights/weekends.  There needs to be a 'No Commercial Parking' sign in this area on Shirlington Road—this sign is posted on other streets in and around the neighborhood.  This was a tragic county/city oversight and needs to be corrected.  This is a safety issue as residents/guests of residents have to park on four mile run (where there is commercial parking available) instead of where the parking was intended to be for residents and business patrons, which was in front of the townhouses when the parking was designed/implemented in the ~2012 timeframe.  This was not intended as a nights and weekend parking lot for commercial vehicles who should be storing their vehicles overnight/on weekends at their place of business. I have lived here since the townhouses were built when no parking existed in front of the community on Shirlington Road and there were four lanes of traffic (no parking) in lieu of what exists today with two lanes of traffic and limited parking--I would have never bought here or pay the taxes had I known commercial trucks would begin parking here every night and weekends consistently.  Please help stop these large, commercial trucks from parking here.  They should park (store) their commercial vehicles at their place of business after hours, and not in front of residences who need these parking spaces.  Or, please change the parking zone to residential only, or paid parking on weekends.  As part of the remedy, my neighbors have begun parking in the Shirlington Crest alleyways which is against the law (there are signs restricting parking) and is a fire hazard, yet my tax-paying neighbors are punished by breaking the law, but the trucks (one with New Jersey license plates--Pat La Frieda Meat Purveyor) who park all night and weekends in parking spaces in front of our community and these commercial trucks/drives suffer no consequences.  Please help fix this with the simple sign that says 'No Commercial Parking,' and ticket them when they do park in these spaces.  Or, put a pay-to-park there.

7891162,Customer Inquiries,"Received in survey comments: This is a general comment and not specific to a particular date of service.  While crews have always worked diligently at picking up recyclables and I have no complaints about the end results, I have noticed that trucks are undermanned and equipment used by crews is not fully operable from time to time.  When this occurs drivers must leave the cab and help with emptying carts into trucks, sometimes having to lift carts manually to deposit contents into trucks.  This would indicate poor management by the recycling company in not having sufficient personnel and/or fully operational equipment.  This seems unfair to workers and could also present a safety hazard.  I am not always home when collections are made and have not been accumulating statistics on these occurrences so can only state that I've observed these shortcomings on enough occasions that I feel obligated to make a report.",COMPLETED,38.8927184,-77.1545605,"2404 North Quintana Street, Arlington, VA, USA",5/6/2020 12:48:00 PM,5/6/2020 12:48:00 PM,This is visible to Everyone,Customer Inquiries
