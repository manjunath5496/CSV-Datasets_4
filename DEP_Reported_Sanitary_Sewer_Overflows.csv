Subject: 10101 Connecticut Avenue - On-Site Sewer Problem

Mr. Martin,

The WSSC wants to alert you of an on-property sewer problem at 10101 Connecticut Avenue, Kensington, 20895.  On 02/05/14, the WSSC investigated a report of water surfacing from a manhole in the rear of the property.  The WSSC found the mainline clear and no WSSC manholes overflowing.  The problem was found with an on-site manhole and the customer was advised to contact a registered plumber.

Thanks,

Mary Murphy

Mr. Martin,

The WSSC would like to inform you of an on-property problem at 3321 May Street, Silver Spring. The WSSC responded to calls of the customer taking in on 3/1/15 and 3/2/15. On 3/1/15, the WSSC sewer main was inspected and found clear. The customer called again on 3/2/15 still complaining of taking in and he stated that he was taking the sewage from his basement and throwing it in his backyard. The WSSC jetted and dyed the sewer main and, once again, found it to be clear.

The overflow was approximately 25 gallons per minute the exact overflowed quantity has not been calculated as of yet.  Some of the overflowing liquid entered a storm drain which empties into Seneca Creek.  WSSC placed lyme down, and posted 54 signs.  The cause is a grease stoppage from the Fox Chapel shopping center.  WSSC will be going out today 03/12/2007 to restore the area and remove any debris.  Code enforcement will be going out to the shopping center to address the grease issue.
