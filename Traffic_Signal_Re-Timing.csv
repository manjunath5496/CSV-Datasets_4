As part of the retiming, the times of day that the side street protected left-turns were extended at Esperanza and Palm, reducing green time on Burnet Road.  In addition, the standards by which we calculate pedestrian crossing times has been recently updated, which required longer crossing times crossing Burnet, reducing green time on Burnet Road when pedestrians are present. Finally, some phasing changes were made, which allowed more vehicular traffic to enter the corridor - so despite the minimal delay increase, throughput has increased."
