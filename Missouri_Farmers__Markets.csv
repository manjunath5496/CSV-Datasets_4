We&#39;re positive you&#39;ll enjoy our pork as much as we do. Our goal is to provide you with the highest quality pork that is raised outdoors with the freedom to express their natural habits. Our 63-acre family farm is nestled in the northwest corner of Johnson County, MO, centrally located between I-70 and 50 hwy.<br><br>We utilize electric fencing and intensively rotate pigs through our farm&#39;s lush pastures and woodlands throughout the year before resting in our winter pastures. In addition to pasture pigs, we raise goat, lamb, and poultry. Our diverse livestock combination symbiotically uses the farm while improving pastures and soil fertility.<br><br>At Harmony Farms, our sows give birth in a peaceful setting chosen by them. We provide shelter and nesting materials (straw, hay, pasture/forage) to keep their young warm and dry. Our animals are never restricted or crated during labor. We breed the hardiest of livestock with superior mothering abilities. These mothers can farrow without crates or heat lamps in outdoor inclement weather, which is one of the reasons we raise delicious, old fashioned, heritage genetic pigs.<br><br>Diverse food sources are a part of our recipe to pork perfection. To start, we feed produce year-round from Buckeye Acres Produce in Warrensburg, MO. The variety of feed the pigs enjoy from day to day are: tomatoes, squash, pumpkins, watermelons, peppers, apples, cucumbers, eggplant and sweetcorn. In addition to the vegetables, our pigs recycle non-alcoholic grains from making whiskey from Restless Spirits Distillery and beer from Cinder Block Brewery. On the farm, this warm treat is known as &quot;pig oatmeal&quot;�. Waste bread, hard boiled eggs, and free choice pasture and hay are also farm favorites. To balance the buffet variety in their diet, we have a custom, antibiotic-free feed mixed for our farm by Vast Feeds in Warrensburg, MO. The significant assortment in their nutrition contributes to tastier pork along with heritage genetics. The longer growth time for these &quot;non-commercialized&quot;� psig allow for further flavor development and richer color of the pork.<br><br>When you&#39;re ready to take your pork to the next level, call us. Our family farm is ready to provide you with superior tasting pork raised humanely and fed for flavor. We offer finished hogs monthly and have roasters available for special events.
