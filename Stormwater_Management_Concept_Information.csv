STORMWATER CONCEPT,283068,06/14/2017,08/24/2017,Burtonsville Town Square Pease Property,"Customer Wants To Use ePlans,The proposed development includes the redevelopment and expansion of the current existing shopping center and parking lot. Approximately 17,000 sqft of building expansion with use for Assembly (A-2), Mercantile (M), Business (B) is proposed in the northeast corner, and 1,650 sqft of building pad expansion with use for General Retail is proposed near the center of the existing shopping center. Easterly access road will be extended north curving towards west, and it will surround the proposed buildings in the northeast of the property. Imperviousness is increased by 0.26 acres. Stormwater Management quantity and quality requirements are currently met through one wet pond and water quality pretreatment for vehicular impervious areas. Stormwater Management quantity and quality include the offsite drainage from the adjacent school site, which drains onto the site in current conditions. Recharge volume is provided with four gravel trenches throughout the site. The existing SWM wet pond is located at the western corner of the development, along the eroded stream valley. The SWM pond discharges flows to a downstream point in the tributary, greatly decreasing the erosion problems to the stream. The pond and outfall location itself address much of the erosion issues along the stream valley. The pond provides control for the 1-year, 24-hour extended detention storm, using a 5.84� opening model by a gate valve, while safely passing the 10-yr and 100-yr storms. The required 1-year, 24-hour extended-detention discharge from the pond is 1.62 cfs. The pond is a standard MD-378 pond with a low hazard class �a� facility. The pond is located within the PMA, so there should be no development or livestock within the vicinity of a dam breach. Stormwater management quality requirements will be met through ESD to MEP to satisfy 1� of PE. The remainder of the required water quality volume will be treated in the existing wet pond located west of the property.",,62,27.6,1.7,0.0,CR,C-2,,,LPR,GENERAL USE,,N,N,N,N,0.0,N,0.0,N,0.0,N,0.0,15650,,OLD COLUMBIA,PIKE,,BURTONSVILLE,MD,20866,
