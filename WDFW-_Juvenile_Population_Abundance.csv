Analysis found 3 of the 40 fish were marked estimating that 7.5% were marked hatchery fish that had escaped from  Palmer ponds. Because the sample was not random and only taken from the largest fish  on two days late in the migration, no attempt was made to estimate the number of these fish captured  during the entire season.

In total 30 maiden captured Chinook were randomly selected and sacrificed between mid March and the end of the trapping season to estimate the number of hatchery fish in our catch and production estimates. To increase our sample size an additional 126 trap mortalities were retained for otolith analysis. The results from the otolith sample included 118 unmarked and 38 otolith marked fish. Sample results were applied to the total catch and production estimate by statistical week and summed by the efficiency strata.
