Kennedy Airport, any new development (as defined in the N.Y.C. Zoning Resolution) of this parcel may require window wall attenuation and an alternate means of ventilation to maintain acceptable interior noise levels. Property owners should consult the most recent noise exposure map for the airport and the N.Y.C. CEPO-CEQR standards to determine the appropriate amount of window-wall attenuation required for any new development. Such measures must be incorporated into the building design in conformance with the aforementioned standards. (10) RESTRICTIVE COVENANT (all parcels): Purchaser/grantee acknowledges that the parcel being conveyed pursuant to this deed (the Parcel) includes a waterfront zoning lot within the meaning of Section 62-11 of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York (the Zoning Resolution). Purchaser/grantee covenants for itself and on behalf of any lessees, subsequent purchasers, successors or assigns to all or any part of the Parcel that, in connection with any proposed development (as such term is defined in Section 62-11 of the Zoning Resolution) on the Parcel purchaser/grantee will comply with all applicable requirements of Chapter 2 of Article VI of the Zoning Resolution, including the requirements of Section 62-711 (Waterfront public access and visual corridors) As part of such obligation, purchaser/grantee shall not apply for nor accept an excavation or building permit for any development on the Parcel, nor shall an excavation or building permit be issued until such time as the Chair of the Department of City Planning certifies to the Department of Building or the Department of Business Services, as applicable, pursuant to Section 62-711 that: (1) no public access or visual corridors are required; (2) that a site plan has been submitted showing compliance with the provisions of Sections 62-40 and 62-60 of the Zoning Resolution, and all other requirements of Section 62-711 have been met; or (3) an authorization pursuant to Section 62-722 (Modifications of Waterfront Public Access and Visual Corridor Requirements) has been granted. For purposes of determining purchaser/grantees waterfront obligations hereunder, such obligations shall be based upon the zoning lot containing the Parcel existing as of September 3, 1997. (11) NOTICE: DEC WETLANDS (when applicable):  All or part of this parcel may be part of a tidal wetland or a tidal wetland adjacent area. Tidal wetlands and tidal wetland adjacent areas are regulated under New York State law by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). DEC has jurisdiction over tidal wetlands and buffer area (the adjacent area), which measures in Broad Channel (and other parts of New York City) up to 150 feet landward of the most landward boundary of a mapped tidal wetland. The official tidal wetland maps can be viewed at the DEC Region 2 offices.  The City of New York makes no representation with respect to the designation of all or part of this parcel as tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area. To the extent that this parcel is within a regulated tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area, important restrictions apply. Depending on the particular circumstances of this parcel, any form of development on this parcel may be prohibited or restricted.","In addition, other activities on the parcel may be prohibited or restricted.  The most important development restrictions can be found in Section 661.6 of the Tidal Wetland Land use Regulations (Title 6, Part 661 of the Official Compilation of the Rules and Regulations of the State of New York). The most important use guidelines can be found in Section 661.5 of the Tidal Wetland Land Use Regulations.  Article 25 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law (the Tidal Wetlands Act) provides that anyone conducting a regulated activity within a tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area must first obtain a permit from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Conducting a regulated activity without a permit constitutes a violation. Any violation of the Tidal Wetlands Act can result in a significant penalty (at the time of this indenture up to $10,000 per day for each violation) as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, unpermitted structures and fill have to be removed at the owners expense. Regulated activities include, for example:  Any form of draining, dredging, excavation and removal (directly or indirectly) of soil, mud, sand, shells, gravel or other aggregate from any tidal wetland;  Any form of dumping, filling or depositing (directly or indirectly) of any soil, stones, sand, mud, gravel, rubbish or fill of any kind;  The erection of any structures or roads, the driving of any pilings or the placing of any other obstructions, whether or not changing the ebb and flow of the tide; and  Any other activity within or immediately adjacent to inventoried wetlands which may substantially impair or alter the natural condition of the tidal wetland area;  Any subdivision of land. This list is not complete. It is therefore advisable to contact the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Region 2, Marine Resources Program prior to any activity within the tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area to clarify whetheror not a permit is required.",CLICK HERE (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/deedmodll176/4154780031deed01.pdf),,,,

Conducting a regulated activity without a permit constitutes a violation. Any violation of the Tidal Wetlands Act can result in a significant penalty (at the time of this indenture up to $10,000 per day for each violation) as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, unpermitted structures and fill have to be removed at the owners expense. Regulated activities include, for example:  Any form of draining, dredging, excavation and removal (directly or indirectly) of soil, mud, sand, shells, gravel or other aggregate from any tidal wetland;  Any form of dumping, filling or depositing (directly or indirectly) of any soil, stones, sand, mud, gravel, rubbish or fill of any kind;  The erection of any structures or roads, the driving of any pilings or the placing of any other obstructions, whether or not changing the ebb and flow of the tide; and  Any other activity within or immediately adjacent to inventoried wetlands which may substantially impair or alter the natural condition of the tidal wetland area;  Any subdivision of land.

Kennedy Airport, any new development (as defined in the N.Y.C. Zoning Resolution) of this parcel may require window wall attenuation and an alternate means of ventilation to maintain acceptable interior noise levels. Property owners should consult the most recent noise exposure map for the airport and the N.Y.C. CEPO-CEQR standards to determine the appropriate amount of window-wall attenuation required for any new development. Such measures must be incorporated into the building design in conformance with the aforementioned standards. (10) RESTRICTIVE COVENANT (all parcels): Purchaser/grantee acknowledges that the parcel being conveyed pursuant to this deed (the Parcel) includes a waterfront zoning lot within the meaning of Section 62-11 of the Zoning Resolution of the City of New York (the Zoning Resolution). Purchaser/grantee covenants for itself and on behalf of any lessees, subsequent purchasers, successors or assigns to all or any part of the Parcel that, in connection with any proposed development (as such term is defined in Section 62-11 of the Zoning Resolution) on the Parcel purchaser/grantee will comply with all applicable requirements of Chapter 2 of Article VI of the Zoning Resolution, including the requirements of Section 62-711 (Waterfront public access and visual corridors) As part of such obligation, purchaser/grantee shall not apply for nor accept an excavation or building permit for any development on the Parcel, nor shall an excavation or building permit be issued until such time as the Chair of the Department of City Planning certifies to the Department of Building or the Department of Business Services, as applicable, pursuant to Section 62-711 that: (1) no public access or visual corridors are required; (2) that a site plan has been submitted showing compliance with the provisions of Sections 62-40 and 62-60 of the Zoning Resolution, and all other requirements of Section 62-711 have been met; or (3) an authorization pursuant to Section 62-722 (Modifications of Waterfront Public Access and Visual Corridor Requirements) has been granted. For purposes of determining purchaser/grantees waterfront obligations hereunder, such obligations shall be based upon the zoning lot containing the Parcel existing as of September 3, 1997. (11) NOTICE: DEC WETLANDS (when applicable):  All or part of this parcel may be part of a tidal wetland or a tidal wetland adjacent area. Tidal wetlands and tidal wetland adjacent areas are regulated under New York State law by the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC). DEC has jurisdiction over tidal wetlands and buffer area (the adjacent area), which measures in Broad Channel (and other parts of New York City) up to 150 feet landward of the most landward boundary of a mapped tidal wetland. The official tidal wetland maps can be viewed at the DEC Region 2 offices.  The City of New York makes no representation with respect to the designation of all or part of this parcel as tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area. To the extent that this parcel is within a regulated tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area, important restrictions apply. Depending on the particular circumstances of this parcel, any form of development on this parcel may be prohibited or restricted.","In addition, other activities on the parcel may be prohibited or restricted.  The most important development restrictions can be found in Section 661.6 of the Tidal Wetland Land use Regulations (Title 6, Part 661 of the Official Compilation of the Rules and Regulations of the State of New York). The most important use guidelines can be found in Section 661.5 of the Tidal Wetland Land Use Regulations.  Article 25 of the New York State Environmental Conservation Law (the Tidal Wetlands Act) provides that anyone conducting a regulated activity within a tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area must first obtain a permit from the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation. Conducting a regulated activity without a permit constitutes a violation. Any violation of the Tidal Wetlands Act can result in a significant penalty (at the time of this indenture up to $10,000 per day for each violation) as well as criminal sanctions. In addition, unpermitted structures and fill have to be removed at the owners expense. Regulated activities include, for example:  Any form of draining, dredging, excavation and removal (directly or indirectly) of soil, mud, sand, shells, gravel or other aggregate from any tidal wetland;  Any form of dumping, filling or depositing (directly or indirectly) of any soil, stones, sand, mud, gravel, rubbish or fill of any kind;  The erection of any structures or roads, the driving of any pilings or the placing of any other obstructions, whether or not changing the ebb and flow of the tide; and  Any other activity within or immediately adjacent to inventoried wetlands which may substantially impair or alter the natural condition of the tidal wetland area;  Any subdivision of land. This list is not complete. It is therefore advisable to contact the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Region 2, Marine Resources Program prior to any activity within the tidal wetland or tidal wetland adjacent area to clarify whetheror not a permit is required.",CLICK HERE (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/deedmodll176/4154000095deed01.pdf),,,,

This restriction shall be binding upon and run with the Premises.   Sewers: 17. (a) It is expressly understood and agreed by the Parties that it is Seller's intention to construct a sewer system to service the entire area known as Broad Channel, Queens (the 'Sewer System') of which the Premises form a part thereof. In connection therewith, Purchaser acknowledges that: (i) the City's four year capital financing program for fiscal years 1983-1986, provides that, commencing with fiscal year 1984, water and sewer capital projects shall be financed through the issuance and sale of water and sewer bonds. Accordingly, the commitment of City capital funds for construction of the Sewer System is contingent upon (A) authorization from the  State of New York for water and sewer bond financing; and (B) closing of such financing in the amounts required by the City's capital financing program. Upon the occurrence of A and B above, commencing with fiscal year 1984 and continuing as necessary through completion, Seller shall include in the Mayor's Executive Budget and the Mayor shall present same for approval by the City's Board of Estimate and City Council, the funding required for the construction of the Sewer System; (ii) due to Broad Channel's unique geographic characteristics, an unconventional, low pressure sewer system ('LPSS') must be utilized, which system involves additional costs and requires different maintenance than that of a conventional sewer system.  (b) In connection with 17(a) above, the Parties agree as follows: (i) Subject to 17(a)(i), Seller shall at its sole cost and expense: A. construct and continuously maintain a gravity collector sewer, pumping station and force main on Cross Bay Boulevard which will connect the pumping station to the Rockaway sewage treatment plant; B. construct a piping system (the 'Laterals'), which will connect the on Premises LPSS  equipment (the 'Grinder Pump') to the gravity collector sewer; and C. upon completion of the LPSS, assign to a not-for-profit corporation formed by the residents of the community commonly known as Broad Channel, Queens (the  'Corporation') whose members shall include all Purchasers, their heirs, successors and assigns, the guarantees and warranties issued by any contractor, vendor, materialman or laborer for the Laterals, the Grinder Pump and their component parts, if any.  (ii) Purchaser consents to the entry upon the Premises, at all reasonable times, of all City personnel, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors and representatives who shall install and connect the Grinder Pump and house connector to the Laterals (the 'Hook Up'); (iii) Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and expense: A. purchase and pay the cost of installation of the Grinder Pump on the Premises. Purchaser shall deposit: 1. the sum of $500 upon Closing; and  2. the additional sum of $1,500 within ten (10) days after notice from Seller that it has awarded a contract or contracts for construction of the force main; all for application to the costs of the purchase and installation of the Grinder Pump (the 'Grinder Pump Fund'). Seller and Corporation shall jointly hold and control the Grinder Pump Fund in an interest bearing account and disburse said fund for the purposes set forth above. In the event that the sum in the Grinder Pump Fund is greater than the cost of the purchase and installation of the Grinder Pump, the excess sums shall be refunded to Purchaser; any deficiency","shall be promptly paid by Purchaser;  B. promptly reimburse Seller for the cost of the Hook Up; C. continuously maintain, repair and/or replace, as necessary, the Grinder Pumps and Hook Up by purchasing and continuously keeping in force a service contract with an independent contractor to perform and pay the costs of service, maintenance, repair and/or replacement, as necessary, and all parts and labor charges related thereto. Upon demand, Purchaser shall furnish Seller proof that said service contract is in force. In the event that Purchaser does not promptly fulfill said responsibilities, Purchaser consents to the entry upon the Premises, at all reasonable times, of all City personnel, employees, agents, contactors, subcontractors and representatives to service, maintain, repair and/or replace the Grinder Pumps and to pay to the City all expenses incurred thereby; D. continuously maintain, repair and/or replace, as necessary, the Laterals by depositing with the Corporation upon Closing the sum of $125, constituting permanent membership of the Purchaser, his heirs, successors and assigns in the Corporation, and Purchaser's proportionate share of either a service contract with an independent contractor or an insurance policy acceptable to Seller, with an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of New York, for the maintenance, repair and/or replacement of the Laterals, to be held by the Corporation.

The restriction that no building, structure or other improvement whatsoever, shall be erected or permitted to be erected or exist on the Premises, other than those erected or existing on the Premises as of August 19, 1982 and repairs, replacements or additions thereto, including one of either a free standing automobile garage or boat garage or tool shed for the personal use of the occupant of the Premises, subject to applicable law, and repairs, replacements or additions thereto. This restriction shall be binding upon and run with the Premises.   Sewers: 17. (a) It is expressly understood and agreed by the Parties that it is Seller's intention to construct a sewer system to service the entire area known as Broad Channel, Queens (the 'Sewer System') of which the Premises form a part thereof. In connection therewith, Purchaser acknowledges that: (i) the City's four year capital financing program for fiscal years 1983-1986, provides that, commencing with fiscal year 1984, water and sewer capital projects shall be financed through the issuance and sale of water and sewer bonds. Accordingly, the commitment of City capital funds for construction of the Sewer System is contingent upon (A) authorization from the  State of New York for water and sewer bond financing; and (B) closing of such financing in the amounts required by the City's capital financing program. Upon the occurrence of A and B above, commencing with fiscal year 1984 and continuing as necessary through completion, Seller shall include in the Mayor's Executive Budget and the Mayor shall present same for approval by the City's Board of Estimate and City Council, the funding required for the construction of the Sewer System; (ii) due to Broad Channel's unique geographic characteristics, an unconventional, low pressure sewer system ('LPSS') must be utilized, which system involves additional costs and requires different maintenance than that of a conventional sewer system.  (b) In connection with 17(a) above, the Parties agree as follows: (i) Subject to 17(a)(i), Seller shall at its sole cost and expense: A. construct and continuously maintain a gravity collector sewer, pumping station and force main on Cross Bay Boulevard which will connect the pumping station to the Rockaway sewage treatment plant; B. construct a piping system (the 'Laterals'), which will connect the on Premises LPSS  equipment (the 'Grinder Pump') to the gravity collector sewer; and C. upon completion of the LPSS, assign to a not-for-profit corporation formed by the residents of the community commonly known as Broad Channel, Queens (the  'Corporation') whose members shall include all Purchasers, their heirs, successors and assigns, the guarantees and warranties issued by any contractor, vendor, materialman or laborer for the Laterals, the Grinder Pump and their component parts, if any.  (ii) Purchaser consents to the entry upon the Premises, at all reasonable times, of all City personnel, employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors and representatives who shall install and connect the Grinder Pump and house connector to the Laterals (the 'Hook Up'); (iii) Purchaser shall, at its sole cost and expense: A. purchase and pay the cost of installation of the Grinder Pump on the Premises. Purchaser shall deposit: 1. the sum of $500 upon Closing; and  2. the additional sum of $1,500 within ten (10) days after notice from Seller that it has awarded a contract or contracts for construction of the force main; all for application to the costs of the purchase and installation of the Grinder Pump (the 'Grinder Pump Fund'). Seller and Corporation shall jointly hold and control the Grinder Pump Fund in an interest bearing account and disburse said fund for the purposes set forth above. In the event that the sum in the Grinder Pump Fund is greater than the cost of the purchase and installation of the Grinder Pump, the excess sums shall be refunded to Purchaser; any deficiency","shall be promptly paid by Purchaser;  B. promptly reimburse Seller for the cost of the Hook Up; C. continuously maintain, repair and/or replace, as necessary, the Grinder Pumps and Hook Up by purchasing and continuously keeping in force a service contract with an independent contractor to perform and pay the costs of service, maintenance, repair and/or replacement, as necessary, and all parts and labor charges related thereto. Upon demand, Purchaser shall furnish Seller proof that said service contract is in force. In the event that Purchaser does not promptly fulfill said responsibilities, Purchaser consents to the entry upon the Premises, at all reasonable times, of all City personnel, employees, agents, contactors, subcontractors and representatives to service, maintain, repair and/or replace the Grinder Pumps and to pay to the City all expenses incurred thereby; D. continuously maintain, repair and/or replace, as necessary, the Laterals by depositing with the Corporation upon Closing the sum of $125, constituting permanent membership of the Purchaser, his heirs, successors and assigns in the Corporation, and Purchaser's proportionate share of either a service contract with an independent contractor or an insurance policy acceptable to Seller, with an insurance company licensed to do business in the State of New York, for the maintenance, repair and/or replacement of the Laterals, to be held by the Corporation. In addition, Purchaser shall thereafter, from time to time, pay to Corporation upon demand, all sums to be assessed for Purchaser's proportionate share of the costs to be incurred in connection with the maintenance, repair and/or replacement, as necessary, of the Laterals; (c) The obligations set forth in the above subsections (ii) and (iii) are binding upon the Parties, their heirs, successors and assigns, shall run with the Premises, failure to pay all sums when due shall result in a lien against the Premises, and all obligations shall survivedelivery of the deed and Closing.",CLICK HERE (https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/dcas/downloads/pdf/deedmodll176/4153160008deed01.pdf),,,,
