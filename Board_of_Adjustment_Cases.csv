However, most sites with V combining district are not located in close proximity to single family properties which trigger compatibility and limit the building height. In this case, the triggering single family zoned properties are 1) located east of a railroad line that separates the triggering properties from the subject property and 2) located within the 25 year floodplain and in a Critical Water Quality Zone (CWQZ), neither of which allow construction on these properties today.",Mixed Use,"A heritage tree is being preserved on the property which reduces density on the site. To recapture some of this lost density, a variance from compatibility is requested based on the following. Compatibility setback and height restriction requirements are being triggered from properties to the east of the site that are separated by a railroad and located in a 25 year floodplain/ Critical Water Quality Zone / Erosion Hazard Zone. All triggering properties except two are owned by the City of Austin (Lots 1 & 2), are currently undeveloped, and because of their location in the CWQZ, they cannot be developed. The other triggering properties are 1108 Jewell Street (Lot 3), a boarded-up single family home and 1405 S. 7th Street, a vacant lot (Lot 4). A vast majority of these properties are in the CWQZ and could not be constructed today.","The compatibility setback will be measured from the Single Family zoned properties on the east side of 7th Street that are outside of the floodplain\CWQZ and are the closest occupied single family residences. Having the slightly greater distance setback will allow for the development of the proposed Vertical Mixed Use project along a Core Transit Corridor while complying with the compatibility setback guidelines. VMU zoning for this property limits height to 60 feet. The project will comply with this height limit. Additionally, the floodplain/CWQZ between the railroad and 7th Street is densely wooded providing a natural visual barrier to the subject property (see photos attached).",CS-V,No,The proposed project will fully comply with compatibility requirements for the single family homes on the east side of South 7th Street.,Height,Approved,05/24/2018 06:41:48 PM +0000,05/14/2018 12:00:00 AM +0000,No,2018,2018,04/06/2018 12:00:00 AM +0000,MONDAY,05/14/2019 12:00:00 AM +0000,5,LOT 3 COMMERCIAL SQUARE,3108170.36375,10065287.013125,30.25343125,-97.76265935,"(30.25343125, -97.76265935)",629919,05/10/2020 10:03:48 PM +0000

Restaurant use allows medical workers to stay in the local area for lunchtime meals.","Property cannot accommodate additional on-site parking. Café Express, the prior restaurant, obtained 24 off-site spaces from nearby US postal office under a parking lease but this lease was terminated when Café Express permanently closed. Doughbird, the new would-be restaurant, intends to remodel the building, preserving the current interior square footage while reducing the patio area to approximately 2,004 sf. LDC 25-6-471's parking requirements nevertheless prevent Doughbird from remodeling and operating a restaurant from property, which now sits vacant.  Doughbird's lease has an initial 15 year term but Doughbird may terminate its lease if the property's parking problem cannot be resolved.",PARKING LOT,"Historically, the property has been used for restaurants - previously Le Madeleine French Bakery and Café followed by Café Express.  Strict enforcement of LDC 25-6-471 prevents Doughbird from investing funds to renovate and refresh the building and thereby continuing a viable restaurant use on the property.
