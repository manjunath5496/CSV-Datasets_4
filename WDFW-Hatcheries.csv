The facility began operations in 1980, as mitigation for lost natural production after dam construction. It underwent a complete three-phase renovation 2005-2013. The culvert was replaced in 2015 to improve fish-passage.<br /><br />The facility has an incubation capacity of 3.6-million eggs and a rearing capacity of two million yearlings. Normal- and late-run coho produced onsite plays an important role in freshwater recreational fisheries, as well as ocean commercial and sport, and Tribal ocean (troll and gillnet). Skookumchuck Hatchery also rears Skykomish stock coho for the South South/Squaxin Island Net Pens program (co-managed by WDFW and the Squaxin Island Tribe). Coho are also provided to various regional enhancement co-ops project sites, including the Chehalis Basin Fisheries Task Force (CBFTF), and regional education co-ops.<br /><br />In addition, Skookumchuck Hatchery spawns, incubates and rears late-winter steelhead returning to the Skookumchuck Dam. A mitigation agreement was signed in 1963 between PacifiCorp and the Washington Department of Game to compensate for the effects of dam construction and operation. The program was transferred from the South Tacoma Hatchery (now Lakewood Hatchery) in 1996. After early-rearing, 90,000 steelhead fry are transferred to the Skookumchuck Dam acclimation ponds in October, for onsite release in April. In addition, eyed-eggs are transferred to the Carlisle Lake (Onalaska High School) and yearlings to Eight Creek project sites (CBFTF) for rearing, acclimation and release.",,,,Thurston,UPPER CHEHALIS,Washington Coastal,Grays Harbor County Lead Entity,3F21802  230761 H,,05/20/2016 12:00:00 AM,
