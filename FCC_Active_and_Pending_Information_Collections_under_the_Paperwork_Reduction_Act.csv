Electric utilities operate Power Line Carrier (PLC) systems in the 9-490 kHz band on power transmission lines for communications important to the reliability and security of electric service to the public.  As a result of this amendment, the Amateur Radio Service will share 
135.7-137.8 kHz and 472-479 kHz bands with PLC systems.  To support the operations of both the Amateur Radio Service and PLC systems in these bands, the Commission adopted a minimum horizontal separation distance of one kilometer between the transmission line and the amateur station when operating in these bands.  Prior to commencement of operations in these bands, amateur operators must notify the Utilities Telecom Council (UTC) of their intent by submitting their call signs, intended band or bands of operation, and the coordinates of their antenna's fixed location.  Amateur stations will be permitted to commence operations after the 30-day period unless UTC notifies the station that its fixed location is located within one kilometer of PLC systems operating in the same or overlapping frequencies.  

This information collection affect only individuals who are licensees in the Amateur Radio Service, i.e., amateur operators.  We note that the coordinates of an applicants fixed site can be determined at no cost to the applicant through the use of commonly available means, i.e., the applicant can use a dedicated Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver, a mobile phone that also provides GPS capability, or an internet-based location service.  Because the call signs of amateur operators are publicly available on the Commissions website, the collection of this information does not cause any additional impact under the Privacy Act and a Privacy Impact Assessment is not required.

Section 97.303(g)(2) states prior to commencement of operations in the 135.7-137.8 kHz (2200 m) and/or 472-479 kHz (630 m) bands, amateur operators shall notify the Utilities Telecom Council (UTC) of their intent to operate by submitting their call signs, intended band or bands of operation, and the coordinates of their antennas fixed location.

The Order adopts the 5G-NR (New Radio) technology standards developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) with Release 15 and requires providers to submit 5G deployment data that meet the specifications of Release 15 (or any successor release that may be adopted by the Commissions Bureaus).   The Order also requires mobile providers to submit broadband and voice subscriber data at the census-tract level based on the subscribers place of primary use for postpaid subscribers and based on the subscribers telephone number for prepaid and resold subscribers.   These changes are necessary because the deployment data collected on Form 477 are no longer sufficient for targeting universal service funds.   The actions to improve the Form 477 data collection will also increase the usefulness of the information to the Commission, Congress, the industry, and the public.

The Order reduces the burden on broadband providers by removing the requirement that facilities-based providers submit separate coverage maps depicting their broadband network coverage areas for each transmission technology and each frequency band.   It also modifies the requirement that mobile broadband providers report coverage information for each technology deployed in their networks by reducing the number of categories from nine to four.

The revisions to 47 C.F.R. Part 25 adopted in the Report and Order remove a portion of the information collection requirements as it relates to a newly proposed low power broadband network, as described in document FCC 16-181.  These revisions enable ATC licensees to operate low-power ATC using licensed spectrum in the 2483.5-2495 MHz band.  

Although the original low-power ATC proposal described the use of the adjacent 2473-2483.5 MHz band, low-power terrestrial operations at 2473-2483.5 MHz were not authorized by the Report and Order.  The revisions provide an exception for low-power ATC from the requirements contained in section 25.149(b) of the Commissions rules, which require detailed showings concerning satellite system coverage and replacement satellites.  The revisions also provide an exception from a rule requiring integrated service, which generally requires that service handsets be capable of communication with both satellites and terrestrial base stations.  Accordingly, the provider of low-power ATC would be relieved from certain burdens that are currently in place in the existing information collection.  To qualify for authority to deploy a low-power terrestrial network in the 2483.5-2495 MHz band, an ATC licensee would need to certify that it will utilize a Network Operating System to manage its terrestrial low-power network.  Although the Report and Order also created new technical requirements for equipment designed to communicate with a low-power ATC network, satisfaction of these technical requirements relieves ATC licensees from meeting other technical requirements that apply to ATC systems generally.

In the 2015 AM revitalization proceeding, the FCC proposed streamlining certain technical requirements to assist AM broadcasters in providing radio service to consumers.  For example, many AM stations must directionalize their signals during some or all of the broadcast day in order to avoid interference with other AM stations.  Maintaining a directional signal pattern can be technically complex, time-consuming, and expensive.  Such stations are subject to a variety of rules requiring signal strength measurements and other engineering analyses to ensure compliance with their authorizations.  In the AMR Third R&O, the FCC eliminated, clarified, or eased several of the rules governing AM stations using directional antenna arrays, which comprise almost 40 percent of all AM stations.  First, the FCC relaxed the rule for partial proofs of performance of certain directional AM antenna systems, by reducing the number of field strength measurements required.  Second, the FCC modified several rules pertaining to AM stations that use Method of Moments (MoM) models of directional array performance.  MoM modeling allows broadcasters to verify antenna system performance through computer modeling, as opposed to sending engineers in the field to take field strength measurements.  Thus, a proof using a MoM model is less expensive than taking field strength measurements of an AM stations directional pattern.",Lisa Scanlan,,Active,03/31/2021,

L. No. 102-243, Dec. 20, 1991.   The TCPA added Section 227 to the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, to restrict the use of automatic telephone dialing systems (autodialers), artificial or prerecorded messages, facsimile machines, or other devices to send unsolicited transmissions. 

The rules prohibit prerecorded message calls to residential lines absent an emergency or the prior express consent of the called party.  Exceptions to this prohibition originally applied if the call:  (a) is not made for a commercial purpose; (b) does not transmit an unsolicited advertisement; (c) is made by a calling party with whom the called party has an established business relationship;  or (d) is made by a tax-exempt nonprofit organization.   In 2012, the Commission eliminated the established business relationship exemption for calls to a wireless telephone number or prerecorded telemarketing calls to a residential line, and the elimination of the exemption became effective at the end of 2013.   However, the other exceptions remain in place.  In addition to the remaining exceptions, the rules prohibit any call, absent an emergency or the prior express consent of the called party, using an automatic telephone dialing system or a prerecorded voice when calling any emergency telephone line (including any 911 line and any emergency line of a hospital, medical physician or service office, health care facility, poison control center, or fire protection or law enforcement agency), any telephone line of any guest room or patient room of a hospital, health care facility, elderly home, or similar establishment, or any telephone numbers assigned to a paging service, cellular telephone service, specialized mobile radio service, or other common carrier service or any service for which the called party is charged for the call.   

The rules further require that telephone solicitors maintain and use company-specific lists of residential subscribers who request not to receive further telephone calls (company-specific do-not-call lists), thereby affording consumers the choice of which solicitors, if any, they will hear from by telephone.   Telephone solicitors also are required to have a written policy for maintaining do-not-call lists, and are responsible for informing and training their personnel of the existence and use of such lists.   Moreover, the rules require that those making telephone solicitations identify themselves to called parties, and that basic identifying information also be included in telephone facsimile transmissions.    

With respect to facsimile transmissions, the rules ban the use of a telephone facsimile machine, computer, or other device to send an unsolicited advertisement unless the sender has an established business relationship with the recipient and the facsimile number is voluntarily obtained in the course of the established business relationship or the number is obtained from the recipients public distribution of its facsimile number, and the sender includes certain notification and disclosure information in the transmission.",Christina Clearwater,cclearwa@fcc.gov,Active,09/30/2021,

Any person or entity proposing to construct or alter an antenna structure that is more than 60.96 meters (200 feet) in height, or that may interfere with the approach or departure space of a nearby airport runway, must notify the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) of proposed construction.  The FAA determines whether the antenna structure constitutes a potential hazard, and may recommend appropriate painting and lighting for the structure.  The Commission then uses the FAA's recommendation to impose specific painting and/or lighting requirements on radio tower owners and subject licensees.  When an antenna structure owner for one reason or another does not register its structure, it then becomes the responsibility of the tenant licensees to ensure that the structure is registered with the Commission.

Section 303(q) of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, gives the Commission authority to require painting and/or illumination of radio towers in cases where there is a reasonable possibility that an antenna structure may cause a hazard to air navigation.  In 1992, Congress amended Sections 303(q) and 503(b)(5) of the Communications Act to make radio tower owners, as well as Commission licensees and permittees responsible for the painting and lighting of radio tower structures, and to provide that non-licensee radio tower owners may be subject to forfeiture for violations of painting or lighting requirements specified by the Commission.

Part 61, Tariff Review Plan (TRP), OMB Control No. 3060-0400:  This is virtually identical to a non-substantive change to this information collection which received OMB approval last November.  Both the previously approved change and the current change allow rate-of-return carriers that elected to freeze their separations category relationships to unfreeze and update those relationships.  The only difference between the two changes is that the previously approved change applies to rate-of-return carriers that elect incentive regulation, while the current change applies to rate-of-return carriers that elect to remain rate-of-return carriers (i.e., that decide not to elect incentive regulation). 

We are requesting same-day approval so that the rule can be published in the Federal Register and take effect by March 1, 2019.  That date is the deadline for rate-of-return carriers to tell the National Exchange Carrier Association (NECA) about changes they plan to make to their tariffs, including whether they elect to take advantage of the rule change for which we seek approval. There is no increase in the burden hours on the public and no costs are associated with this information collection.  

This submission is being made as a non-substantive change request to OMB for existing information collections (OMB Control Nos. 3060-0298, 3060-0400, 3060-0770, and 3060-1247) pursuant to 44 U.S.C.  3507.

For rate-of-return carriers, this material includes cost-of-service information.  As a result of the rule changes, carriers electing incentive regulation will continue to file TRPs, but will file less burdensome, non-cost-based TRPs similar to those filed by price cap carriers, which also are covered by the existing information collection. The rule changes also allow certain rate-of-return carriers that previously froze their federal/state separations category relationships to unfreeze and update those category relationships.  These carriers will file cost-based TRPs as part of setting their initial incentive regulation rates and thereafter will file non-cost-based TRPs.

In its 2017 Spectrum Frontiers Second Report and Order (FCC 17-152), the Commission expanded the UMFUS rules to cover the 24 GHz and 47 GHz bands.  In its December 2018 Fourth Report and Order (FCC 18-180), the Commission established an incentive auction that promotes the flexible-use wireless service rules that the Commission has adopted for the Upper 37 GHz, 39 GHz, and 47 GHz bands and, among other things, adopted modified band plans for these bands.  

There are currently a number of existing licenses in the 39 GHz band that do not fit geographically into the Commissions new 39 GHz band plan, resulting in encumbered licenses that break up blocks of spectrum and fragment frequencies across the 39 GHz band.  The Commission will use the incentive auction process to resolve the difficulties presented by these encumbrances and the need for existing 39 GHz licenses to be transitioned efficiently to the new band plan and possibly to new service areas.  To that end, pursuant to the reconfiguration process adopted in the Fourth Report and Order, prior to the incentive auction, the Commission will offer each incumbent 39 GHz licensee a reconfiguration of its existing 39 GHz licenses that conforms more closely with the Commissions new band plan and service areas. Each incumbent can then choose to commit to (1) have its existing 39 GHz licenses modified based on the Commissions reconfiguration proposal; or (2) have its licenses modified based on an alternative reconfiguration proposed by the incumbent (provided it satisfies certain specified conditions); or (3) relinquish its existing spectrum usage rights in exchange for an incentive payment to be paid from the proceeds of the auction.    

An incumbent 39 GHz licensee will submit contact and related information and certifications on FCC Form 175-A which will be used by the Commission to enable the incumbent licensee to make its commitment to either accept modification of its 39 GHz spectrum holdings (either as proposed by the Commission or an acceptable alternate) or to relinquish its existing spectrum usage rights in exchange for an incentive payment, as described above.",Valerie Barrish,,Active,05/31/2022,

The revision is necessary to implement the final rules promulgated in the 2018 Report and Order in WT Docket No. 17-228, FCC 18-167 (2018 Order), which eliminated unnecessary and outdated information collection requirements for wireless service providers and replaced these requirements for service providers with a revised web site posting and record retention requirement and a streamlined annual certification requirement.   The 2018 Order did not make changes to the currently approved reporting requirements for device manufacturers.

The Commissions previous hearing aid compatibility reporting requirements for service providers were intended to provide the Commission with a way to verify compliance with rules requiring service providers to offer specified numbers of hearing aid-compatible handset models, to monitor the status of hearing aid-compatible handset deployment in the marketplace, and to ensure that consumers have access to information about the handset models that serve their needs.  The Commissions revised and enhanced web site posting, record retention, and annual certification requirements for service providers are an improved means of promoting those goals.

These non-substantive changes to FCC Form 655 and its instructions were already approved by OMB.

The Commission anticipated that the targeted changes made in its 2018 Report and Order will spur additional investment and broader deployment in the band, promote robust and efficient spectrum use, and help ensure the rapid deployment of advanced wireless technologiesincluding 5Gin the United States.

The rule changes and information requirements contained in the Commissions previous 3.5 GHz band ordersthe 2015 Report and Order, FCC 15-47, and 2016 Order on Reconsideration and Second Report and Order, FCC 16-55, both in GN Docket No. 12-354are also approved under this Office of Management and Budget (OMB) control number (3060-1211) and have not changed since OMB last approved them.

This supporting statement discusses only the performance requirements from the 2018 Report and Order.

The Commission seeks approval from OMB for the information collection requirements contained in the 2018 Report and Order, FCC 18-149, stemming from the changes made to section 96.25(b) of it rules.  The Commission revised section 96.25(b) to adopt performance requirements for Priority Access Licensees.  Specifically, under the revised rule, Priority Access Licensees must provide substantial service in their license area by the end of the initial license term, i.e., at the end of 10 years.  Substantial service is defined as service which is sound, favorable, and substantially above the level of mediocre service which might minimally warrant renewal.  Failure by any licensee to meet this requirement will result in forfeiture of the license without further Commission action, and the licensee will be ineligible to regain it.  

Licensees shall demonstrate compliance with the performance requirement by filing a construction notification with the Commission in accordance with section 1.946(d) of the Commissions rules.  The licensee must certify whether it has met the performance requirement, and file supporting documentation, including description and demonstration of the bona fide service provided, electronic maps accurately depicting the boundaries of the license area and where in the license area the licensee provides service that meets the performance requirement, supporting technical documentation, any population-related assumptions or data used in determining the population covered by a service to the extent any were relied upon, and any 

other information the Wireless Telecommunications Bureau may prescribe by public notice.

These measures are designed to limit or avoid protracted and contentious interference disputes, provide translator licensees additional investment certainty and flexibility to remediate interference, and provide affected stations earlier and expedited resolution of interference complaints. Under this new information collection, the following information collection requirements require OMB approval.  

Specifically, the FM Translator Interference Report and Order pertains to this new Information Collection as it codifies the translator interference listener complaint requirements under section 74.1201(k) and sections 74.1203(a)(3)  (actual interference) and 74.1204(f)  (predicted interference) of the rules.  The Commission defines the requirements for a listener complaint submitted with a translator interference claim in section 74.1201(k) as a complaint that is signed and dated by the listener and contains the following information: (1) the complainants full name, address, and phone number; (2) a clear, concise, and accurate description of the location where the interference is alleged or predicted to occur; (3) a statement that the complainant listens to the desired station using an over-the-air signal at least twice a month, to demonstrate the complainant is a regular listener; and (4) a statement that the complainant has no legal, employment, financial, or familial affiliation or relationship with the desired station, to demonstrate the complainant is disinterested.  Electronic signatures are acceptable for this purpose.  

The FM Translator Interference Report and Order establishes a minimum number of listener complaints, ranging from 6 to 25, depending on the population served within the protected contour of the complaining station.  The Commission explains that a proportionate approach, which was supported by multiple commenters, would be fairer and more effective than a single minimum number for all complaining stations.  In addition to the required minimum number of valid listener complaints, a station submitting a translator interference claim package pursuant to either section 74.1203(a)(3) or 74.1204(f) must include: (1) a map plotting the specific locations of the alleged interference in relation to the 45 dBu contour of the complaining station; (2) a statement that the complaining station is operating within its licensed parameters; (3) a statement that the complaining station licensee has used commercially reasonable efforts to inform the relevant translator licensee of the claimed interference and attempted private resolution; and (4) U/D data demonstrating that at each listener location the ratio of undesired to desired signal strength exceeds -20 dB for co-channel situations, -6 dB for first-adjacent channel situations or 40 dB for second- or third-adjacent channel situations, calculated using the Commissions standard contour prediction methodology set out in section 73.313.  

In the FM Translator Interference Report and Order, the Commission outlines two paths for resolving interference if the translator decides to continue operation on its original channel.  First, a translator operator may resolve each listener complaint by working with a willing listener to resolve reception issues.  The translator operator must then document and certify that the desired station can now be heard on the listeners receiver, i.e., that the adjustment to or replacement of the listeners receiving equipment actually resolved the interference.",Lisa Scalan,,Active,07/31/2022,

FCC staff use the data to ensure that applicant meets basic statutory requirements and will not cause interference to other licensed broadcast services.

On May 9, 2019, the Commission adopted a Report and Order, Amendment of Part 74 of the Commissions Rules Regarding FM Translator Interference, FCC 19-40, MB Docket No. 18-119,  adopting proposals to streamline the rules relating to interference caused by FM translators and to expedite the translator interference complaint resolution process.  These measures are designed to limit or avoid protracted and contentious interference disputes, provide translator licensees additional investment certainty and flexibility to remediate interference, and provide affected stations earlier and expedited resolution of interference complaints. 

In the Report and Order, the Commission adopted its proposal to offer additional flexibility to FM translator licensees, by allowing them to resolve interference issues using the effective and low-cost method of submitting a minor modification application to change frequency to any available same-band FM channel.  This method will reduce the number of opposition pleadings filed and the obligation to defend an interference claim.   

Specifically, the FM Translator Interference Report and Order pertains to this Information Collection as it modifies Section 74.1233(a)(1) of the rules to define an FM translator stations change to any available same-band frequency using a minor modification application, filed using FCC Form 2100, Schedule 349, upon a showing of interference to or from any other broadcast station.  Prior to the FM Translator Interference Report and Order, if an existing FM translator caused actual interference, as prohibited by Section 74.1203(a), it was limited to remedial channel changes, filing FCC Form 2100, Schedule 349 as a minor change application, to only first, second, or third adjacent, or IF channels.  A change to any other channel was considered a major change on FCC Form 2100, Schedule 349, which could only be submitted during a filing window.  The FM Translator Interference Report and Order enables more translator stations to cure interference by simply changing channels within the same band by filing Form 2100, Schedule 349 as a minor change application, rather than other costlier and less efficient remedies.  

With this submission, the Commission is currently seeking to obtain OMB approval for the revision to Section 74.1233(a)(1) of the rules.  This revision will modify the number of respondents, number of responses, annual burden hours, and annual costs for this collection.",Lisa Scalan,,Active,07/31/2022,

The collections in the modified ETRS forms are consistent with those approved by the Office of Management and Budget in the 2011 and 2017 revisions to the EAS PRA collection set forth in the FCCs EAS Third Report and Order and in the related 2011 emergency request (and subsequent standard request) for approval of the electronic version of that previously approved collection (and the PRA filing made for the ETRS when it became a mandatory filing mechanism in 2015).  

The current modification to the ETRS is to improve and clarify the filing experience.  Every change requested either improves efficiency or clarifies previously unclear points for the user.  In some cases, we are proposing to implement changes that users requested.  The FCCs Public Safety and Homeland Security Bureau (PSHSB or Bureau), working with the ETRS developers, has made every effort to draft these modifications to be minimal, non-material changes, consistent with previous OMB approvals.

In the Third Report and Order in this proceeding, the Commission harmonized and streamlined the Commission's rules regarding tower construction near AM stations.  

In AM radio, the tower itself functions as the antenna.  Consequently, a nearby tower may become an unintended part of the AM antenna system, reradiating the AM signal and distorting the authorized AM radiation pattern.  Our old rules contained several sections concerning tower construction near AM antennas that were intended to protect AM stations from the effects of such tower construction, specifically, Sections 73.1692, 22.371, and 27.63.  These old rule sections imposed differing requirements on the broadcast and wireless entities, although the issue is the same regardless of the types of antennas mounted on a tower.  Other rule parts, such as Part 90 and Part 24, entirely lacked provisions for protecting AM stations from possible effects of nearby tower construction.  In the Third Report and Order the Commission adopted a uniform set of rules applicable to all services, thus establishing a single protection scheme regarding tower construction near AM tower arrays.  The Third Report and Order also designates ""moment method"" computer modeling as the principal means of determining whether a nearby tower affects an AM radiation pattern.

The 3.7 GHz-4.2 GHz band currently is allocated in the United States exclusively for non-Federal use on a primary basis for Fixed Satellite Service (FSS) and Fixed Service.  Domestically, space station operators use the 3.7-4.2 GHz band to provide downlink signals of various bandwidths to licensed transmit-receive, registered receive-only, and unregistered receive-only earth stations throughout the United States.  The 3.7 GHz Report and Order calls for the relocation of existing FSS operations in the band into the upper 200 megahertz of the band (4.0-4.2 GHz) and making the lower 280 megahertz (3.7-3.98 GHz) available for flexible-use throughout the contiguous United States through a Commission-administered public auction of overlay licenses that is scheduled to occur later this year.   The Commission adopted a robust transition schedule to achieve an expeditious relocation of FSS operations and ensure that a significant amount of spectrum is made available quickly for next-generation wireless deployments, while also ensuring effective accommodation of relocated incumbent users.  The 3.7 GHz Report and Order establishes a deadline of December 5, 2025, for full relocation to ensure that all FSS operations are cleared in a timely manner, but provides an opportunity for accelerated clearing of the band by allowing incumbent space station operators  to commit to voluntarily relocate on a two-phased accelerated schedule (with additional obligations and incentives for such operators), with a Phase I deadline of December 5, 2021, and a Phase II deadline of December 5, 2023.

The Commission concluded in the 3.7 GHz Report and Order that, before the public auction of overlay licenses commences, it is appropriate for potential bidders to know when they will get access to the spectrum in the 3.7-3.98 GHz band that is currently occupied by incumbent FSS space station operators and earth stations,  and to have an estimate of how much they may be required to pay for incumbent relocation costs and accelerated relocation payments should they become overlay licensees.
